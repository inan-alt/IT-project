					<h3>The Ones Who Rules The Streets</h3>
					<p>
						Every superhero has a coterie of villains and so does Batman. Prominent ones include Penguin, Two-Face, Riddler, Mr.Freeze, Bane, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn etc.

					<h3>No Killing</h3>
					<p>
						Even the villains are responsible for horrible crimes and murders whose punishment according to the law should be a death sentence, but Batman is not the one who wants to provide the death sentence. Which I find very commendable as how does he manage to keep his calm even after witnessing so many horrible crimes happen infront of him, ever since the dath of his parents. But all of the villains have their own story as well. Maybe Batman relates with them as they all had a troubled childhood but did not have the luck to be born into one of the wealthiest families of the world.
